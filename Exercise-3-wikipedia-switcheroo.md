# Wikipedia switcheroo

1. Create a repository on your desktop called ‘planets’ with a readme.md and commit it. 
2. Choose a Wikipedia page about a planet of your choice. 
3. Copy the first paragraph about the planet, paste it into your readme.md and commit it.
4. Create a new branch (git branch <branchname>) and switch to it (git checkout <branchname>).
5. In atom, add Wikipedia entry about another planet into that branch’s readme. 
6. Save, commit, close out of atom.
7. In your browser, open the readme file. 
8. Does the file show your first planet? Or the second?
